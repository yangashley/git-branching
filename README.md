# git-branching

In main.py is a simple function to print my name and others in my family. 

As an instructor I will: 
 - show how to create a new branch
   - In VSCode
   - Using this command in the terminal: git checkout -b <branch_name>
 - make edits to the existing function in main.py
 - push those changes to github
 - make a pull request
 - merge my branch into the main branch
